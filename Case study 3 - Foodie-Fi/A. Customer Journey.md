 A. Customer Journey

*Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief
description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also
want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!*

### Solution

```sql
select customer_id,
	plan_name,
        start_date,
	timestampdiff(day, lag(start_date) over(partition by customer_id order by start_date), start_date) as day_difference,
        timestampdiff(month, lag(start_date) over(partition by customer_id order by start_date), start_date) as month_difference
from subscriptions
join plans using (plan_id)
where customer_id in ('1', '2', '11', '13', '15', '16', '18', '19')
order by customer_id
;
```
customer_id | plan_name | start_date | day_difference
